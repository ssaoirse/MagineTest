The app has been built and compiled using Xcode 9, Swift version 4.0.

ThirdParty:
SwiftOverlays has been used to show activity indicator. The source can be found here

Design:
An attempt has been made to use ideas from the MVVM/VIPER architecture. The Router and
the Presenter component are missing. The task of Presenter is being performed by the 
Interactor layer itself.
